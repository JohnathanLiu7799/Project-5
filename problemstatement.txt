problem statement:

Estimate state vaccine consumption 
    -with vacc hestitancy
    -with goal of creating more efficient vaccine allocations

Who are we doing this for?
    -common public (more efficiently allocated vaccines means more people who want it can get it)
    -government (less wasted resources)
    -medical companies (less wasted vaccines)

Background
    -What resources are consumed when vaccines are being held in storage long term

How are we identifying success:
    loss function:
    -difference between vaccines allocated and vaccines used

# COVID – 19 Vaccine Consumption

COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus named SARS-CoV-2 and was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. It is highly contagious and has quickly spread around the world ([source](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-covid-19-vaccine)). On December 11, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. On December 18, 2020, the FDA issued an EUA for the use of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. And on February 27, 2021 the FDA issued an EUA for the use of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. It was not until August 23, 2021, the FDA approved the first COVID-19 vaccine, known as the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, now known as Comirnaty ([source](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-covid-19-vaccine)). Vaccine hesitancy has been identified as a leading global health treat. The top four reasons for vaccine hesitancy are: 1. Safety and efficacy concerns 2. Preference for physiological immunity 3. Distrust in government and health organizations 4. Autonomy and personal freedom ([source](https://www.aafp.org/journals/fpm/blogs/inpractice/entry/countering_vaccine_hesitancy.html)).
